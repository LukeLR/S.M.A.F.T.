# S.M.A.F.T.
S.M.A.F.T. is an abbreviation for "**S**uper **M**ega **A**wesome **F**ancy **T**etris" - S.M.A.F.T. :wink: As the name says, it's a remake of that famous game "Tetris" written in Java. The idea for S.M.A.F.T. came up on a LAN party, around 5 am, so therefore the ambitions of this game are not set too high. Furthermore, as for today (Juni 29th, 2015), the application is still in pre-alpha state, so running the game is impossible (after all, it is impossible to launch the application at all :wink:). Even more, it is unknown if this game will always come to a point where it is usable and runnable. Therefore don't try your luck, move on, nothing to see here ;)
